provided for each month. Generated line plot must include the following properƟes:
a) X label name = Month Number 
b) Y label name = Total profit 
2. Get total profit of all months and show line plot with the following Style properƟes.
Total profit data provided for each month (same as 1st quesƟon). Generated line plot
must include following Style properƟes:
a) Line Style doƩed and Line-color should be red 
b) Show legend at the lower right locaƟon.
c) X label name = Month Number 
d) Y label name = Sold units number 
e) Add a circle marker. 
f) Line marker color as read 
g) Line width should be 3 
3. Display the number of units sold per month for each product using mulƟline plots.
(i.e., Separate Plotline for each product). 
4. Read toothpaste sales data of each month and show it using a scaƩer plot. Also, add a
grid in the plot, gridline style should be “–“. 
5. Read face cream and facewash product sales data and show it using the bar chart. The 
bar chart should display the number of units sold per month for each product. Add a 
separate bar for each product in the same chart.

	Problem: 1

You are given a dataset (data.csv) containing two columns - 'X' (independent variable) and 'y'
(dependent variahle). Implement a simple linear regressinn model using Python to predict 'y' hased
on 'X'. Load the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and train the linear regression model.
Finally, predict the values for the test set and calculate the mean squared error.

	Problem:2

You are provided with a dataset (data.csv) containing three columns - 'feature1', 'feature2', and
'target' (binary classification). Implement a Decision Tree classifier using Python to predict the
'target' based on the features. Load the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and train the
Decision Tree model. Finally, predict the values for the test set and calculate the accuracy.
